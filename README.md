# Cyberpunk 2077 Breach Protocol Solver with Brute Force Algorithm
Brute force algorithm is an algorithm used to solve programming problems. The approach in this algorithm is straight forward in solving a problem. The brute force algorithm is very simple, direct, clear, and easy to implement. Therefore, I used an algorithm to solve Cyberpunk 2077 Breach Protocol with python and implemnt it in react flask web.

## Setup

For the libraries, please check the `requirements.txt` file. You can install the libraries by using the command below.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
You can run the program by using the command below then open the link to use it.
P.S.: I tried to create an executable file, but it resulted in an error. Therefore, you can use this command to run it.

```bash
python src/app.py
```

On the web, you'll find two buttons on the left side. Here, you can choose to input data either from a file or manually from your keyboard. After inputting your data, you can press the 'Solve' button to see the result.
